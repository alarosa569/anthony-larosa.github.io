# Anthony LaRosa Data Science: About Me
My name is Anthony LaRosa and I have been an IT Professional for 11 years. My undergraduate studies were in Information Technology with a concentration in Network and Server Infrastructure. I began my career working part time at UPenn, and then moving on to a position in a large power company. My initial focus was in Network Engineering, but the business and project management was always my core interest. Over the years I became more engaged in those core interests which led to me working on program management to drive value towards an array of initiatives with a targeted focus.

The results that I derive always had a strict focus on the data and logic under the covers, but not until the last couple years did I discover the field of data science which drives perfect alignment to my mission. 
This page is a collection of my project and work utilizing data science principles that I have learned at my time in Bellevue Universities MS in Data Science Graduate Program.
