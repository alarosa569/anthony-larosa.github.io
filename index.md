## Welcome to Anthony LaRosa's Portfolio 

This collection of pages is from my personal work and progress from 2019 to 2021 exploring data science principles. My research and projects over this course of time were during my Master studies at Bellevue University. Each of the projects in the respective page held some form of personal interesting of mine. I think that is one of the great componenets of data science. We live in a data driven world, and from that, there are many opportunities to utilize the techniques found throughout these pages to drive improvements in society. 

My detailed Github repository with a collection of all code can be accessed here: [Anthony LaRosa Github](https://github.com/alarosa569/anthony-larosa.github.io/tree/gh-pages)
